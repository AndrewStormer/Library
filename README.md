# Library_database
Library database in MySQL created for my database applications and information systems course at the University of Missouri.

# Startup
This application needs a server_config.py file to run, the file should be in the form:

config = {
  'user': 'username',
  'password': 'user_password',
  'host': '127.0.0.1'
}

where 'username' and 'password' should correspond to the login user and password of your MySQL server
